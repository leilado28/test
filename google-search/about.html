                        You must be familiar with the term "political consulting". You may or may not know the meaning of the word, but vaguely know that it's a form of consulting that works and assists with political campaign. The word "assistance" conveys so much more meanings and depth than just simply helping with campaigns. Political consulting is a cash cow industry that is so powerful in bringing success to political campaigns, from small state campaigns to presidential campaigns.

                        <p>Starting from the initial research of the influence industry in political campaigns, I decided to dive deeper into the political consulting industry and see the impact it has on the success of campaigns.

                        Political consulting industry lives and hides itself from the news and awareness of the public for so long. I tried google "Political Consulting Industry" and "Political Consulting companies," but all the results I received were vague descriptions and companies that did not align with the <a href = "https://drive.google.com/file/d/1-MBt9o9SFUCZTGVZtktIRaxZEPm_xYb-/view">dataset</a> I received. 
                        <br><br>
                        From the difficulty to find accurate and straightforward information, I decided to create Poligle, a search system that is dedicated and committed to provide straightforward and uncover hidden information about the industry to the light.
